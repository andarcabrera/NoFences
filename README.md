NoFences is a web application that provides newcomers to the city of Chicago a platform to get in touch with locals who want to help. NoFences also acts as an aggregator of organizations providing services to immigrants, as well as information about the demographic diversity of the City of Chicago. The app was built using Ruby on Rails along with jQuery, Ajax, JavaScript, the D3 library, and several APIs (Facebook, Google Maps, I18N and AWS).
